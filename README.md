# Alexandria - a simple book manager

This app is an [Udacity](http://udacity.com) [Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) exercise
and part of the project "Superduo".


## Todo

### Must have

- app has barcode scanning functionality √
- does not crash while searching for a book without an internet connection √

### Nice to have

- Alexandria’s barcode scanning functionality does not require the installation of a separate app
  on first use
- Extra error cases are found, accounted for, and called out in code comments
- Strings are all included in the strings.xml file and untranslatable strings have a translatable
  tag marked to false.
